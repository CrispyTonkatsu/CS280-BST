Implement BST as discussed in the slides. Instead of storing a single piece of data 
per node we store a pair (key, value) which is viewed as
"map [ key ] = value".

Follow the driver:
implement
1) BST insert (Done)
2) BST find and basic non-const iterator features - constructor and comparison to "end" (Done)
3) BST delete (Done)
4) iterator post and pre increment (successor) and decrement ( predecessor) (Missing decrement)
5) iterator derefencing (Done)
6) BST copy and assignment (should be O(N) - proportional to the number of elements in the tree) (Done)
7) BST move copy and assignment (C++11 feature - extra credit), should be constant time. (Done)
